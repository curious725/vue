It  is  a   very    basic   piece   of  HTML    code    that    contains    an  unordered   list    of
elements,   where   each    element is  presented   with    a   checkbox    and a   textâ€”an input   for the user
text    and the Add!    button. Each    time    the Add!    button  is  clicked,    the content of  the text    input   is
transformed into    a   list    entry   and appended    to  the list.   When    the checkbox    of  any item    is
clicked,    the state   of  an  entry   is  toggled from    to  to  buy (unchecked) to  bought  (checked).
