Data    binding:    changing    the text    bound   to  the model's property    affects the text    bound   to  the
same    property    immediately

Data    binding:    changing    an  array   affects lists   based   on  it  immediately

The v-on    directive   attaches    an  event   listener    to  the elements.   The shortcut    is  the @   sign.   So,
instead of  writing v-on:keyup="addItem" ,  you can write   @keyup="addItem".   You can read
more    about   the v-on    directive   on  the official    documentation   site    at  http://vuejs.org/api/#v-on  .
